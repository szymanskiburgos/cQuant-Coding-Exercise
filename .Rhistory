# we can observe cyclic patterns in the spot-price data at multiple levels: months in a year, days in a month, and hours in a day
# months: avg energy prices across SettlementPoints are highest in the Summer months, peaking in August.
# high energy prices in the late Summer likely reflect the fact that the hottest months of the year for the US are July and August
# which is when demand for electricity will be highest as residents and commercial establishments are relying on air conditioning to stay cool
# we would have expected energy prices to show peaks also at the height on winter when energy demand is high for heating
# given this result, I would investigate whether the data are excluding fuels in the calculation of energy prices
# such as natural gas, propane, etc. in other words, the prices may be reflecting just electricity prices
# days: avg energy prices appear to exhibit a cyclic trend in the week whereby energy prices tend higher toward the end of the week
# we can reasonably expect energy demand to rise around weekends when people tend to stay up later and thus use more
# electricity throughout the night. additionally, factors like increased rates of social events, longer hours for establishments, etc.
# will affect weekend energy demand
# hours: within the day, avg energy prices are highest in the late afternoon/early nighttime when energy demand will peak
# as residents and commercial establishments use lighting that was not necessary during the day
# however, as we go further into the night, energy demand dips back down to reflect that residents are going to sleep and establishments are closing
